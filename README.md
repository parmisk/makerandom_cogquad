# makerandom_cogquad
Creates Randomization for cog-quad protocol
This protocol includes four tasks and the tasks are paired two groups to be completed on the same day. 
Within each pair, the randomization determines the order in which the tasks are conducted.
This ensures randomization occurs both between the two categories of tasks (pair 1 vs. pair 2) and within each pair of tasks (e.g., which task comes first within the pair).
